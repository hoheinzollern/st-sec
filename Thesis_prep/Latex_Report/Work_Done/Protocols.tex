\section{Security Protocols} % Message deduction?
Security protocols is an abstract or concrete protocol, that characterise the security related functions and applies cryptographic methods. It describes how the algorithm should be used to ensure the security and integrity of data transmitted. The security protocol is a protocol that runs in an untrusted environment, where it usually assumes channels are untrusted and participants are dishonest. In academic examples, they are often described through Alice, Bob and an adversary Eve, using the Dolev-Yao model.
