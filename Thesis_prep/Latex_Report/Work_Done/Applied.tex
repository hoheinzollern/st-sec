\section{Applied $\pi$-Calculus}
%Short - examples of the applied $\pi$-calculus 
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item General about Applied Pi Calculus, and how it differs from pi calculus (terms; in particular for security protocols)
%  \item Examples of applied pi calculus (handshake protocol?)
%  \item ProVerif - automatic symbolic protocol verifier
%\end{itemize}

The applied pi-calculus (ref. Abadi and Fournet, 2001) is based upon the language pi-calculus, but offers a more convenient use for modelling security protocols to be specified, by allowing for a more wide variety of complex primitives. It is used for describing and analysing security protocols, as it provides a more intuitive process syntax for detailing the actions of the participants in a protocol \autocite{AplliedPiCalsulus2010}. This is done by introducing a rich term algebra, for modelling the cryptographic operations used in security protocols, where function symbols represent cryptographic protocols. 

Tools such as ProVerif \autocite{ProVerif}, uses a syntax closely related to the applied pi-calculus, and offers a way of automated reasoning about the security properties found in cryptographic protocols. \\
%- The properties of these primitives are modelled by equations \\ 

TODO: Grammar for process as well, as it differs from the Pi-calculus

%"The applied pi calculus (...) is a language for describing concurrent processes and their interactions". \\
\subsection{Process and Terms}
As mentioned, the applied pi-calculus uses Terms, and such differs from the Pi Calculus, where only names are used, to model messages that are exchanged during a protocol. Terms are built over a signature, names and variables\autocite{AplliedPiCalsulus2010}: (grammar - missing vertical bar)\\
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular} { l l }
 		L, M, N, T, U, V ::= & terms \\ 
 		a, b, c,...,k,...,m, n,..,s & names \\  
 		x, y, z & variables \\
 		g(M$_{1}$,..,M$_{l}$) & function application

\subsection{Re-visiting the Needham-Schroeder Protocol}
Having established an understanding of how the the applied pi-calculus differentiate from the pi-calculus, we can now use it to get a better understanding of the Needham-Schroeder Protocol previously introduced.\\

First of, we look at the simple Handshake protocol used for setting the parameters for communication between two devices, such as the old dial-up modem or when connecting to a USB.  \\
Handshake protocol with applied pi-calculus as illustred by \citeauthor{AplliedPiCalsulus2010}:
