\label{chap:Introduction}
The purpose of this report, is to establish a foundation for a future thesis by the author, in regards of extending session types to model security properties with the introduction of adversaries.

In the report I will first introduce the motivation for exploring this field, as well as the current research done in the area. Secondly, I will introduce different research areas, all related to the field, and how these work together as background knowledge for the further thesis, by which I will explain further about in the final section of this report. 

\section{Motivation}
With IT becoming an ever bigger part of our lives, the need for stronger and better security measurements, has grown with it. \\
Voting machines \\
Confidentiality \\
Ever expanding field \\
Tighter restrictions (session types - adversaries) \\
TPM (new security measurement) \\

\section{Current research}
The project relies heavily on the research done within the field of Security protocols and Session types. \\
Mark Ryan's research on the TPM (citation). \\
ProVerif?

\section{Intended outcome}
"The intended outcome of the thesis, is to take the idea of session type and choreography programming, and consider them in an adversarial environment. This will be done by extending session types to model properties, and
from this produce protocols that are secure by construction." (Taken from Thesis prep agreement). \\
